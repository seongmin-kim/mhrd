Full Adder Specification
========================

Description:
------------
The FULLADDER is only different to the HALFADDER in that it has as additional
input called "carry in". The resulting sum is the sum of all three input bits.
In contrast to the HALFADDER, chaining multiple FULLADDERS enables you to sum
up number bigger than 1 bit.
Check the appendix in the manual for binary notation of numbers and binary
arithmetics.

Interface Specification:
------------------------
Inputs: carryIn, in1, in2;
Outputs: out, carryOut;
