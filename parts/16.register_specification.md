1-Bit Register Specification
============================

```
Description:
------------
Like the DFF element the REGISTER element has an internal state, an input and
an output. The internal state of the REGISTER however is only set to the value
of the input in case the input load flag is 1.
Check the DFF specification and the manual for sequential logic.
